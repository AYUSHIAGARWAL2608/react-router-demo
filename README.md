#### React demo Project

React Router is a third-party library that’s widely popular for its design and simplicity.

#### Routing

Routing is the process of keeping the browser URL in sync with what’s being rendered on the page. React Router lets you handle routing declaratively. The declarative routing approach allows you to control the data flow in your application, by saying “the route should look like this”:

<Route path="/about">
  <About />
</Route>


basic navigational routing
nested routing
nested routing with path parameters
protected routing


####

The React Router library comprises three packages: react-router, react-router-dom, and react-router-native. The core package for the router is react-router, whereas the other two are environment specific. You should use react-router-dom if you’re building a website, and react-router-native if you’re in a mobile app development environment using React Native.
